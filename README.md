# BasiX: Ten consoles, put into into one file.
![BasiX](https://github.com/goooofie/BasiX/assets/120129825/b17551e1-9d7d-4f67-b511-d0facb28bd1b)

BasiX simplifies gaming history by bundling ten consoles into one convenient emulation file pack. No need to search endlessly for ROMs and emulators. Unlike Retroarch, BasiX is simply a large file with mulitple folders, while not having the bloatware/uselss emulators you don't use. Only the classics, N64, PS2, Wii, Gamecube, etc.
