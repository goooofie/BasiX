BasiX simplifies gaming history by bundling ten consoles into one convenient emulation file pack. No need to search endlessly for ROMs and emulators. Unlike Retroarch, BasiX is simply a large file with mulitple folders, while not having the bloatware/uselss emulators you don't use. Only the classics, N64, PS2, Wii, Gamecube, etc.

⚠️ **THIS IS THE BASIC VERSION OF CLASSIX, IF YOU WANT SOMETHING BIGGER, CHECK OUT CLASSIX** ⚠️

# Advantages

**Smaller:** BasiX is much smaller than ClassIX, only having 10 consoles. This makes it better if you have a bad internet connection.

**Simple:** BasiX is also much more basic than ClassIX, so you will spend less time navigating if you only care about main consoles.

**Convenient:** Just navagate through the folders and open your favorite emulator.

**Only what you need:** There is no useless emulators that you will not use. Just the childhood favorites.
